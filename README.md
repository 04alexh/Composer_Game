# Composer_Game
I have refactored all of the code of my "mahler game 1.0" so that it is using some better practices. Keep in mind though I am using this project to teach myself C++ so it is still kinda spaghetti code.


**HOW DOES IT WORK**

This is a music guessing game. There are rule explanations in the game, but here's the basics:

  You get some clip and have to guess symphony number, movement number, and/or composer depending on your settings
  
  There are multiple difficulties and modes
  
  Get points that scale with difficulty
  
  Use hints to rehear a clip if you couldn't tell what the clip was


  **DISCLAIMER**

  If you want to play this game, you need to actually have the music files as .wav files. I can't just upload music here so it would only work if you get the music yourself.
  If you do this:
  
  Name each song in this format -> [composer last name].[symphony number].[movement number].wav   Exp: Mahler 3, Mo 2 is named Mahler.3.2.wav
    
  Put all of the composers songs in a folder with the composer's last name
    
  Put these folders in the same spot as your .exe files

  These instructions probably don't even work, I'm just guessing. I don't really know how someone would be able to run this in another spot.
